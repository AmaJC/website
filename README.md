If you're getting image not found:

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/lib

Coding Conventions:
- Use "_" for filenames
- Use Font Awesome for icons
- Don't use JS if it's doable using CSS3
- Use good markup: Make things extensible, use classes and IDs efficiently, use the right semantics
